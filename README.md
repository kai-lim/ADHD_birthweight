# [The role of birth weight on the causal pathway to child and adolescent ADHD symptomatology](https://kai-lim.github.io/ADHD_birthweight/)

This is my first R research project and also my first published paper, which I conducted during the final year of my undergraduate. The project is currently published on the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry. You can access the paper [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6175300/pdf/JCPP-59-1036.pdf).

The step-by-step R script in htlml format is available on:  https://kai-lim.github.io/ADHD_birthweight/ 

## Summary ðŸŽ¯
In this project, I used structural equation modelling to study the effect of birthweight on ADHD symptoms in a longitudinal fashion from childhood to adolescoence. By using data from thousands of monozygotic twins, we could control for genetic and shared environmnetal confoundings. We found that lower birth weight is on the causal pathway to elevated ADHD symptoms. This effect persists across a 14-year period from childhood into late adolescence, in particular for inattention symptoms. 

## Data visualisations ðŸŽ¨

### Figure 1
Predicted ADHD symptoms of monozygotic twins from age 8 to 16 years

### Figure 2
Absolute standardized monozygotic twin estimates with 95% CI for total ADHD, hyperactivity/impulsivity (Hyp/Imp) and inattention symptoms across ages 8, 12, 14 and 16 years. All estimates are absolute values. The larger the estimates, the greater the effect of birth weight on ADHD symptoms.
