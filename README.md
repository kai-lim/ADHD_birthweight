# The role of birth weight on the causal pathway to child and adolescent ADHD symptomatology

This is my first R research project and also my first published paper, which I conducted during the final year of my undergraduate. The project is currently published on the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry. You can access the paper [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6175300/pdf/JCPP-59-1036.pdf)
